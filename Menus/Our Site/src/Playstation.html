        This is the PS1. Released in December 3rd, 1994 this was the best console of it's time.
        The console was made by Sony Computers entertainment and was the first console made by the company, released around the world not
        long after it's first release in Japan.
        Although the PS1 isn't as popular as PS2's and the rest of the PlayStation family it has things that other consoles don't like a great
        startup sound that you cannot find on other consoles.
