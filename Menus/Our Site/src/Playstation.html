            This is the PS1. Released in December 3rd, 1994 this was the best console of it's time.
            The console was made by Sony Computers entertainment and was the first console made by
            the company, released around the world not
            long after it's first release in Japan. Although the PS1 isn't as popular as PS2's and
            the rest of the PlayStation family it has things that other consoles don't like a great
            startup sound that you cannot find on other consoles.
            So go ahead and buy one, and a couple games!
